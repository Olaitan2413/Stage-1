Antimicrobial Resistance In Cancer Epidemiology\
&#x20;**Introduction**

Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major challenge to public health and has garnered significant attention because of its crucial implications for public health (Bratti et al., 2023). AMR not only causes considerable death but it is also estimated that it is going to be the leading cause of death by 2050 if a solution is not found. Furthermore, it increases healthcare expenditure with the US spending about US$20 billion and €1.1 billion in the European Union (Dadgostar., 2019).

Cancer is another significant contributor to mortality rates in the general population. Nevertheless, the detrimental impact of AMR in cancer is caused by both disease-related and treatment-related immunosuppression. Among cancer patients undergoing treatment, hospitalisations due to severe sepsis account for 20% of all hospitalisations, while cancer-related deaths caused by severe sepsis account for 8.5% of all cancer-related deaths (Bratti et al., 2023). Infections are a common occurrence in patients with cancer, and individuals with cancer are three times more likely to die from a severe infection compared to those without cancer. It is believed that infections are a major factor in the cause of death in around 50% of patients with haematological malignancies or solid tumours. However, it is important to note that drug-resistant infections are seldom listed as the official cause of death on the death certificates (Nanayakkara et al., 2021).

Research have shown that bacteria are the primary cause of infections in cancer patients. The potential infection risks that researchers have identified include the compromise of anatomical barriers, surgical procedures, neutropenia caused by chemotherapy and radiation, and stem cell transplantation. Recently, there has been an increased vulnerability to infection due to the implementation of toxicity reduction measures in the utilisation of advanced immunotherapies that specifically target cancer (Nanayakkara et al., 2021). During neutropenic therapy, cancer patients often receive extended preventive and direct administration of antibiotics as part of their treatment. However, it is likely that the widespread and prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates associated with infections in cancer patients can be attributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Scheler et al., 2020).

**Conclusion** Although the direct cost of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in relation to cancer has not been specifically studied, it can be inferred that it would impose a greater financial burden on the healthcare system. While several measures have been implemented in the control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there is a need to create awareness about the misuse of antibiotics. Additionally, there is a race among researchers to develop an alternative cancer treatment that will limit or eliminate the use of antibiotics.\
